# Active-Directory-Foundation-Building

#Executive Summary
--

This repository documents the design, deployment, and operational validation of a structured on-premises Active Directory infrastructure built to simulate enterprise identity management and policy enforcement.

The environment was architected to establish a stable domain foundation, including Domain Services (AD DS), integrated DNS, organizational unit (OU) strategy, security group design, Group Policy enforcement, and layered access control using Share and NTFS permissions.

During implementation, multiple infrastructure-level challenges were encountered and resolved, including static IP misconfiguration, DNS registration failure, network profile inconsistencies, VM network isolation issues, Group Policy scope misalignment (N/A state), and security filtering misconfiguration involving Authenticated Users vs Domain Users.

The project demonstrates foundational expertise in Active Directory architecture, dependency management, security boundary design, and structured troubleshooting within a domain environment.
